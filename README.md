This project involves a comprehensive analysis of US data stored in a CSV file, utilizing Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis process includes loading the data into a DataFrame, cleaning it by handling missing values and correcting data types, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate descriptive statistics and visualize the distribution of key variables. Various plots, including histograms, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots, are created to uncover significant trends and patterns. Insights derived from these visualizations are summarized to facilitate better understanding and decision-making based on the identified trends. The project provides a structured approach to data analysis, ensuring that the data is thoroughly explored and valuable insights are extracted.
